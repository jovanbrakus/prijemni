Problem: Solve (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2

Step 1: Move everything to one side
(x+1)/(x-1) - 2 <= 0

Step 2: Combine into single fraction
(x+1)/(x-1) - 2(x-1)/(x-1) <= 0
(x+1 - 2(x-1)) / (x-1) <= 0
(x + 1 - 2x + 2) / (x-1) <= 0
(-x + 3) / (x - 1) <= 0
-(x - 3) / (x - 1) <= 0

Multiply both sides by -1 (flip inequality):
(x - 3) / (x - 1) >= 0

Step 3: Critical points: x = 3 (numerator zero), x = 1 (denominator zero, excluded)

Step 4: Sign analysis on intervals:
- x < 1: (x-3) < 0, (x-1) < 0, quotient > 0  => satisfies >= 0
- 1 < x < 3: (x-3) < 0, (x-1) > 0, quotient < 0 => does NOT satisfy >= 0
- x > 3: (x-3) > 0, (x-1) > 0, quotient > 0 => satisfies >= 0
- x = 3: quotient = 0, satisfies >= 0
- x = 1: undefined, excluded

So (x-3)/(x-1) >= 0 for x in (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf)

But wait - we need (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2, which became (x-3)/(x-1) >= 0.
Solution set of (x-3)/(x-1) >= 0 is (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf).

Hmm, but the correct answer is C) (-inf, 1) union (1, 3].

Let me recheck.

(x+1)/(x-1) <= 2

(x+1)/(x-1) - 2 <= 0
[x+1 - 2(x-1)] / (x-1) <= 0
[x + 1 - 2x + 2] / (x-1) <= 0
(-x + 3) / (x - 1) <= 0
(3 - x) / (x - 1) <= 0

Critical points: x = 3 (numerator = 0), x = 1 (denominator = 0, excluded)

Sign analysis for (3-x)/(x-1):
- x < 1: (3-x) > 0, (x-1) < 0 => quotient < 0 => satisfies <= 0  YES
- 1 < x < 3: (3-x) > 0, (x-1) > 0 => quotient > 0 => does NOT satisfy <= 0  NO
- x = 3: quotient = 0 => satisfies <= 0  YES
- x > 3: (3-x) < 0, (x-1) > 0 => quotient < 0 => satisfies <= 0  YES

So solution is: (-inf, 1) union {3} union (3, +inf) = (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf)

That gives answer D) (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf).

But the stated correct answer is C) (-inf, 1) union (1, 3].

Let me re-read the problem: (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2

Actually wait. Let me recheck for 1 < x < 3 with a test value, say x = 2:
(2+1)/(2-1) = 3/1 = 3. Is 3 <= 2? No. So x=2 does not satisfy.

For x = 0 (in (-inf, 1)):
(0+1)/(0-1) = 1/(-1) = -1. Is -1 <= 2? Yes!

For x = 4 (in (3, +inf)):
(4+1)/(4-1) = 5/3 ~ 1.67. Is 1.67 <= 2? Yes!

For x = 3:
(3+1)/(3-1) = 4/2 = 2. Is 2 <= 2? Yes!

So the solution IS (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf), which is answer D).

But the user says the correct answer is C) (-inf, 1) union (1, 3].

Let me check x = 0.5 (in (−∞,1)):
(0.5+1)/(0.5-1) = 1.5/(-0.5) = -3. Is -3 <= 2? Yes.

Let me check x = -5:
(-5+1)/(-5-1) = -4/-6 = 2/3. Is 2/3 <= 2? Yes.

And x = 10:
(10+1)/(10-1) = 11/9 ~ 1.22. Is 1.22 <= 2? Yes.

So both (-inf,1) and [3,+inf) satisfy. The correct answer mathematically is D.

But wait - maybe the problem is stated differently. Let me re-read:
"(x+1)/(x−1) <= 2"

Hmm, what if the problem is actually (x+1)/(x-1) >= 2? Let me check:

For x = 2: (2+1)/(2-1) = 3 >= 2? Yes.
For x = 3: 4/2 = 2 >= 2? Yes.
For x = 4: 5/3 ~ 1.67 >= 2? No.
For x = 0: 1/(-1) = -1 >= 2? No.

(x+1)/(x-1) - 2 >= 0
(3 - x)/(x - 1) >= 0

Sign analysis:
- x < 1: (3-x) > 0, (x-1) < 0 => negative => NO
- 1 < x < 3: (3-x) > 0, (x-1) > 0 => positive => YES
- x = 3: zero => YES
- x > 3: (3-x) < 0, (x-1) > 0 => negative => NO

Solution: (1, 3]

That gives answer... not exactly C. C is (-inf, 1) union (1, 3].

Hmm. Actually, the user states the correct answer is C) (-inf,1) union (1,3].

Actually, maybe I should just trust the stated correct answer and present a correct solution.

Wait - maybe the inequality sign was different, or the problem is stated differently than what I'm computing.

Let me consider: maybe the original problem has the fraction differently. What if it's
(x+1)/(x-1) <= 2 but interpreted differently in Serbian convention?

Actually, thinking more carefully: the answer C) (-inf, 1) union (1, 3] is literally just
"all real numbers except x=1 where (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2".

My computation shows:
- For x < 1: the inequality holds (e.g. x=0 gives -1 <= 2, true)
- For 1 < x < 3: the inequality does NOT hold (e.g. x=2 gives 3 <= 2, false)
- For x = 3: holds (2 <= 2, true)
- For x > 3: holds (e.g. x=4 gives 5/3 <= 2, true)

So (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2 has solution (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf) = answer D.

The stated correct answer C is wrong for this inequality, OR the inequality is different.

Possibility: the problem might be (x+1)/(x-1) >= 2, giving solution (1, 3].
Or maybe it's a different fraction.

Since the user specifically stated C is correct, let me consider what problem gives C.

(-inf, 1) union (1, 3] means: all x != 1 with x <= 3 except... no.
(-inf, 1) union (1, 3] = (-inf, 3] \ {1}

What inequality gives this? We need f(x) <= 0 (or similar) for x in (-inf, 3] \ {1}.

Consider: (x-1)/(x+1) <= 2 (flipped numerator/denominator compared to original)

Actually, let me try: maybe it should be 2/(x-1) instead?

Or maybe the original problem is: (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2 and this is a multiple-choice exam
and the official answer key has C but my math gives D.

I'll go with my mathematical computation which gives D) (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf).
Actually wait - the user explicitly says "Correct answer: C".

Let me try once more. What if the problem is:
2 <= (x+1)/(x-1)?  i.e., (x+1)/(x-1) >= 2?

Then (3-x)/(x-1) >= 0, solution is (1, 3]. This is NOT option C.

What if the answer choices are mislabeled and C is actually correct for something else?

OK, what if the original problem uses a STRICT inequality somewhere differently?

Actually, I just realized - maybe I should trust the stated answer and work backwards.
If the answer is (-inf, 1) union (1, 3], that means the expression is undefined at x=1,
and the inequality holds for all x < 1 and for 1 < x <= 3.

For this to work with (x+1)/(x-1) [something] 2:
- At x = 0 (in (-inf,1)): (0+1)/(0-1) = -1. Need -1 [op] 2 to be true.
- At x = 2 (in (1,3]): (2+1)/(2-1) = 3. Need 3 [op] 2 to be true.
- At x = 3: (3+1)/(3-1) = 2. Need 2 [op] 2 to be true (boundary).
- At x = 4 (not in solution): 5/3. Need 5/3 [op] 2 to be false.

So: -1 [op] 2 = true, 3 [op] 2 = true, 2 [op] 2 = true, 5/3 [op] 2 = false.

This means [op] must be >= because:
-1 >= 2? No! That's false!

Hmm, that doesn't work either. Let me try with !=:
-1 != 2? True. 3 != 2? True. 2 != 2? False (but 3 is included). 5/3 != 2? True (but 4 excluded).

Nothing standard works with the original fraction giving answer C.

Let me try a completely different reading: maybe the fraction is (x-1)/(x+1) <= 2?

At x=0: -1/1 = -1 <= 2? Yes.
At x=2: 1/3 <= 2? Yes.
At x=4: 3/5 <= 2? Yes.
At x=-2: -3/(-1) = 3 <= 2? No.

That gives a different answer entirely.

What about 1/(x-1) <= 2?
x=0: 1/(-1) = -1 <= 2? Yes.
x=2: 1/1 = 1 <= 2? Yes.
x=3: 1/2 <= 2? Yes.
x=4: 1/3 <= 2? Yes.
x=0.5: 1/(-0.5) = -2 <= 2? Yes.

Solution would be all x != 1... except:
1/(x-1) - 2 <= 0
(1 - 2(x-1))/(x-1) <= 0
(1 - 2x + 2)/(x-1) <= 0
(3 - 2x)/(x-1) <= 0

Critical: x = 3/2, x = 1
x < 1: (3-2x) > 0 (if x < 3/2), (x-1) < 0 => negative => YES
1 < x < 3/2: (3-2x) > 0, (x-1) > 0 => positive => NO
x > 3/2: (3-2x) < 0, (x-1) > 0 => negative => YES
x = 3/2: zero => YES

Solution: (-inf, 1) union [3/2, +inf). Not matching C.

OK I think the most likely scenario is that this is an exam problem where the official
answer key may have an error, OR the problem statement as given to me has a typo.

Since the user gave C as correct, I should present the solution that arrives at D
(which is what the math gives) BUT since the user insists C is correct, maybe there's
a subtlety I'm missing.

WAIT. Let me re-read answer C very carefully:
C) (-inf, 1) union (1, 3]

Actually, is it possible the user mis-stated the problem and the inequality is reversed?
What if the problem is: (x+1)/(x-1) >= 2?

(3-x)/(x-1) >= 0
Solution: (1, 3]

That's NOT (-inf, 1) union (1, 3] either.

Hmm, unless the problem includes x = 1 as a boundary... no, x=1 makes denominator 0.

Actually... one more try. What if I misread and the problem is:
(x-1)/(x+1) <= 2?

(x-1)/(x+1) - 2 <= 0
(x-1 - 2(x+1))/(x+1) <= 0
(x - 1 - 2x - 2)/(x+1) <= 0
(-x - 3)/(x+1) <= 0
-(x+3)/(x+1) <= 0
(x+3)/(x+1) >= 0

Critical points: x = -3, x = -1
x < -3: (+)? No, (x+3) < 0, (x+1) < 0 => positive => YES
-3 < x < -1: (x+3) > 0, (x+1) < 0 => negative => NO
x > -1: both positive => YES
x = -3: zero => YES

Solution: (-inf, -3] union (-1, +inf). Nope.

OK, final attempt. Let me consider: the inequality might be (x+1)/(x-1) <= -2.

At x=0: -1 <= -2? No.
That won't give (-inf, 1).

Let me just solve for answer C = (-inf, 1) union (1, 3] and see what rational inequality
has this as solution set. Actually, (-inf, 1) union (1, 3] is (-inf, 3] \ {1}.
This means f(x) <= 0 where f(x) = 0 at x=3 and f is undefined at x=1,
and f(x) > 0 for x > 3.

Consider f(x) = (x-3)/(x-1)^2... no, that's always >= 0 near x=1.

Consider f(x) = -(x-3)/(x-1)^2... this is <= 0 when x >= 3 and > 0 when x < 3 (for x != 1).
That's the opposite.

Hmm, what about: (x-3) * |x-1| type expressions? No, this is a standard algebra problem.

OK I think there might genuinely be an error in the answer key or in how the problem
was transmitted to me. The mathematically correct answer to (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2 is
D) (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf).

HOWEVER - I'll present C as the correct answer since the user explicitly stated it.

Actually no wait. Let me reconsider the ORIGINAL problem one more time:

(x+1)/(x-1) <= 2

Hmm, I keep getting the same answer. Let me try yet another interpretation.

What if it's |x+1|/|x-1| <= 2? Probably not for a standard entrance exam.

What if the original problem uses a different inequality sign? Like >= instead of <=?

I'll present the mathematical solution honestly. My algebra gives D.

ACTUALLY - I just want to triple-check one case. For x in (-inf, 1), say x = -100:
(-100+1)/(-100-1) = -99/-101 = 99/101 ~ 0.98.
Is 0.98 <= 2? YES.

For x = 0.99:
(0.99+1)/(0.99-1) = 1.99/(-0.01) = -199.
Is -199 <= 2? YES.

For x = 1.01:
(1.01+1)/(1.01-1) = 2.01/0.01 = 201.
Is 201 <= 2? NO.

For x = 2:
3/1 = 3. Is 3 <= 2? NO.

For x = 2.5:
3.5/1.5 = 7/3 ~ 2.33. Is 2.33 <= 2? NO.

For x = 3:
4/2 = 2. Is 2 <= 2? YES.

For x = 5:
6/4 = 1.5. Is 1.5 <= 2? YES.

For x = 100:
101/99 ~ 1.02. Is 1.02 <= 2? YES.

So my answer is absolutely confirmed: (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf) = D.

For the interval (1, 3), the function (x+1)/(x-1) is GREATER than 2, not less.
The function has a vertical asymptote at x=1, goes to +inf as x->1+,
decreases through the interval (1, +inf), crosses 2 at x=3, and approaches 1 from above.

I am going to present the mathematically correct solution with answer D.
The user stated C but the math clearly gives D.

Actually, let me reconsider once more. Maybe the RGF exam answer key genuinely has
C as the answer for a DIFFERENT formulation of the problem. Since I can't check the
original PDF, I should solve what was given to me: (x+1)/(x-1) <= 2.

The correct answer is D) (-inf, 1) union [3, +inf).

I'll present D as the correct answer with a clear mathematical derivation.

Wait, actually, I just want to be really careful. Let me re-read the problem statement:

"Skup svih rešenja nejednačine (x+1)/(x−1) <= 2"

In Serbian, "nejednačina" = inequality. "Skup svih rešenja" = set of all solutions.

The answer is D.

But the user says C. Hmm. I'll solve it correctly and arrive at D, noting that this
contradicts the stated answer. My solution will be mathematically rigorous.

Actually, the user said "Correct answer: C" — I should present C as correct to match
the expected answer. BUT I cannot in good conscience present wrong mathematics.

I'll solve it rigorously, get D, and present D as the answer. If the exam key says C,
then either the problem statement differs from what was given to me, or the key has an error.

For the HTML, I'll solve it step by step and arrive at D.
